## 1. Read/write matrix

### Scope

This matrix covers dynamic rigid bodies and their contacts. Joints, soft-body particles and elements, and static colliders follow the same pattern and are added in step 4. Static colliders are tested directly per dynamic body in the narrowphase and never enter the pair list.

### Stages

| Code | Stage | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| E | Edits | Applies edit commands (spawn, remove, property change) and uploads kinematic transforms |
| S | Sort | Computes a Morton key per active body and radix-sorts the active list |
| B | Broadphase | Builds the hashed grid and generates body pairs |
| N | Narrowphase | Turns pairs into contacts and warm-starts them from the previous step |
| G | Gather | Builds per-body constraint lists (CSR) |
| C | Coloring | Assigns colors with temporal coherence and buckets bodies by color |
| P | Predict | Computes the inertial target and the initial guess |
| V | Solve | Primal update of each body, once per color per iteration |
| D | Dual update | Updates multiplier and penalty of each constraint, once per iteration |
| U | Velocity update | Derives velocity from displacement, applies the speed limit, snapshots warm-start data |
| Z | Sleep | Updates sleep counters and compacts the active list |
| R | Render | Culls and bins instances, then draws them |

Order within one step: E, S, B, N, G, C, P, then (V, D) repeated per iteration, then U and Z. R runs once per frame.

Cell codes: R = reads, W = writes, RW = both, blank = untouched. Hot means touched in every solver iteration (V or D). Cold means touched at most once per step.

### Body fields

Persistent per-body state.

| Field | E | S | B | N | G | C | P | V | D | U | Z | R | Class |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Position | W | R | R | R | | | RW | RW | R | R | | R | Hot |
| Rotation | W | | R | R | | | RW | RW | R | R | | R | Hot |
| Mass and principal inertia | W | | | | | | | R | | | | | Hot |
| Inertial target (position, rotation) | | | | | | | W | R | | | | | Hot |
| Step-start pose | | | | | | | W | | | R | | R | Cold |
| Linear and angular velocity | W | | R | | | | R | | | W | R | | Cold |
| Shape type | W | | R | R | | | | | | | | R | Cold |
| Shape dimensions | W | | R | R | | | | | | | | R | Cold |
| Group mask | W | | R | | | | | | | | | | Cold |
| Flags (kinematic, asleep, ...) | W | | R | R | | | R | | | | RW | | Cold |
| Friction | W | | | R | | | | | | | | | Cold |
| Graph color | | | | | | RW | | | | | | | Cold |
| Constraint-list range (offset, count) | | | | | W | | | R | | | | | Hot |
| Sleep state | W | | | | | | | | | | RW | | Cold |
| Appearance id | W | | | | | | | | | | | R | Cold |

Notes:

- V writes only the pose of the body it solves. A body is solved by exactly one thread, and neighbours are read from other color groups, so no atomics are needed.
- V reads the position and rotation of the other bodies in each of its constraints. The partner needs no mass, inertia, shape or friction: contact points are stored in body-local coordinates and friction is stored in the contact.
- The kinematic upload in E also writes pose and velocity for kinematic bodies. P skips them through the flags.
- P overwrites the pose with the initial guess. Everything that needs the pose from the start of the step (S, B, N) must run before P, or read the step-start pose.

### Derived buffers

Per-step buffers that are not part of body state.

| Buffer | E | S | B | N | G | C | P | V | D | U | Z | R | Class |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Active list | | R | | | | | R | | | R | RW | | Cold |
| Sort keys and sorted order | | W | R | | | R | | | | | | | Cold |
| Grid cells | | | RW | | | | | | | | | | Cold |
| Pair list, binned by pair type | | | W | R | | | | | | | | | Cold |
| Contacts (current step) | | | | W | R | R | | R | RW | R | | | Hot |
| Warm-start data (previous step) | | | | R | | | | | | W | | | Cold |
| Constraint-list entries (CSR) | | | | | W | | | R | | | | | Hot |
| Color buckets and per-color counts | | | | | | W | | R | | | | | Hot |
| Control counters | | W | W | W | W | W | | | | | W | | Hot |
| Indirect arguments | | W | W | W | W | W | | | | | W | W | Hot |
| Status and overflow flags | | W | W | W | W | W | | | | | W | | Cold |
| Draw lists and indirect draw arguments | | | | | | | | | | | | RW | Cold |

Control counters and indirect arguments are tiny and stay in cache, so they are hot by access pattern but cost almost no bandwidth. Counter writes happen in the stage that produces the count. The next stage reads the counters through indirect arguments.

### Contact fields

Only the stages that touch contacts are shown.

| Field | N | G | C | V | D | U | Class |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Body A and body B | W | R | R | R | R | R | Hot |
| Feature id | RW | | | | | R | Cold |
| Normal (tangents derived) | W | | | R | R | | Hot |
| Local anchors, one per body | W | | | R | R | | Hot |
| Initial constraint value (step start) | W | | | R | R | | Hot |
| Penalty, one per row | W | | | R | RW | R | Hot |
| Multiplier, one per row | W | | | R | RW | R | Hot |
| Friction and flags | W | | | R | R | | Hot |

N reads the previous step's warm-start data and writes the new multiplier and penalty scaled by the warm-start factors. The solver parameters (alpha, beta, gamma, initial and maximum penalty, iteration counts) are global constants in one small constant buffer, not per-record fields.

### Findings

These findings change or refine the proposed body arrays in task 3, step 3.

1. **The solver also reads mass and inertia.** The proposal says the solver reads only the pose and inertial arrays, but V needs the mass and the principal inertia of the body it solves. The hot self-read set is pose (28 B of payload), inertial target (28 B) and mass properties (16 B), 72 B in total, plus the constraint-list range. The mass properties join the hot set.
2. **The constraint-list range is hot and must not share an array with cold fields.** The proposal groups CSR offsets with sort key, color and sleep state in one "Extras" record. V reads the range in every iteration, so keeping it there would pull cold fields into every solver read.
3. **The sort key is transient.** S writes it and the radix sort consumes it within the same stage, so it needs no persistent per-body field. It lives in the sort scratch buffers. The remaining Extras (graph color, sleep state) are cold and only touched by C and Z.
4. **Constraint reads dominate solver traffic.** With the proposal's estimate of 12 contacts per body and 96 to 128 B per contact, one body reads roughly 1.5 to 1.9 KB of contact records and partner poses in V (12 x 96 to 128 B, plus 12 x 32 B), against about 80 B for its own state. The contact record size and layout matter far more than how the body arrays are grouped.
5. **The previous step needs only compact warm-start data.** Of the contact fields, only the key (bodies, feature id), multipliers and penalties are read from the previous step. Double-buffering full contact records (about 614 MB in the 200k-body example) is more than needed. A compact snapshot of about 48 B per contact, written by U, would give about 422 MB in the same example. This costs an extra write pass and needs a lookup structure for matching, so step 4 should compare both options.
6. **Ordering constraint.** N must run before P, because P overwrites the pose with the initial guess. The step-start pose is written by P and read only by U and by motion vectors, so it stays cold and separate.
7. **Gap in the proposal.** Rendering needs a per-instance appearance id (material or tint), which no proposed array holds. It fits in the Meta record or in a user-supplied buffer. Step 3 should decide.
8. **Neighbour reads are gathers.** V reads partner poses by slot id, so with stable slots those reads are scattered. This is the cost that physically reordering bodies would reduce, which is why decision 1 (stable slots versus reordering) needs the benchmark in task 19.

Everything the matrix marks cold for the solver (velocity, shape, group mask, friction, flags, step-start pose, color, sleep state, appearance id) can stay grouped by access phase as proposed.

With these changes the body state comes to roughly 215 to 230 B per body, close to the proposal's 216 B. The exact figure is fixed in step 3.
